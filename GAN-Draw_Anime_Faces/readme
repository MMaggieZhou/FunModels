updates 11/07/2022: 
  - model training output(sample images/checkpoint/loss history) are persisted to google drive; while test data remains on training computing unit 
  - add code to checkpoint and resume last checkpoing.
  Now the training can be resumable from where it's interrupted, instead of starting from the beginning!!
  - generalize model to be able to support DCGAN with or without weight clip
  - modularize code for training 
  (I have a rough model trained with WGAN and now training a model without, and working on adding FID as evaluation metric)
